# cryopodbot
A bot completely coded in Python 3.5 for helping out the CryopodToHell subreddit!

This bot runs in Python 3.5, and mainly only uses PRAW and Discord.py - you'll have to install those with pip seperately.

It contains all the files, including failed projects (i.e. Project STAT, which was, in a way, brought back recently in the discord update as a discord-only feature.
This means that it contains the Reddit bot, the Discord bot, most of the files they depend on, as well as a few temporary tests that should be ignored.

Please note this project is under the GNU General Public License, which states that any changes to the code MUST be made available to other users. See the `LICENSE` file for more details.

Finally, if you have any questions about the above, feel free to contact me on the cryopod's discord, which is at https://discord.gg/EkdeJER

Thank you!
